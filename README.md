# simpleUI
A Simple UI design for Chat interface for Ollama, built with Electron.

The idea came from wanting to create a siimple 'turn key' app that can be used for students (my niece). For details on the story you can check out my article [Ollama UI for Students (PartÂ 2)](link). The UI allows customization of the colors to make it quite different from someone else.
