# simpleUI
A Simple UI design for Chat interface for Ollama, built with Electron.

The idea came from wanting to create a siimple 'turn key' app that can be used for students (my niece). For details on the story you can check out my article [Ollama UI for Students (PartÂ 2) - Not active yet](link). The UI allows customization of the colors to make it quite different from someone else. 

<table style="width: 100%; border-collapse: collapse;">
  <tr>
    <td style="padding: 0; width: 50%;"><img src=".github/UI_image1.png" alt="Main Interface" style="width: 100%;"></td>
    <td style="padding: 0; width: 50%;"><img src=".github/UI_image2.png" alt="Settings Panel" style="width: 100%;"></td>
  </tr>
</table>

You are free to modify anything you like, this is intended only for my educational purpose and not intended for production. Just needed a quick simpueUI to connect to my local [Ollama](https://ollama.com/). and I would be updating this as I use it more as it is useful to me.
